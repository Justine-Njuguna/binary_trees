# Binary Tree Project in C
This project implements various functions to manipulate and interact with binary trees in C. The focus is on simple binary trees, not specialized structures like Binary Search Trees (BSTs) or AVL trees.

Project Setup
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compilation: gcc on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
Coding Style: Betty Style (enforced by betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)
Project Structure
README.md: This file (you're reading it now!) explains the project goals and usage.
binary_trees.h: Required header file including prototypes for all binary tree functions.
Source files: Each file containing function implementations and limited to 5 functions per file. Each source file should include binary_trees.h.
main.c (optional): You can use this for testing but it won't be used for grading.
Data Structures
The project utilizes the following data structure for binary trees:

Simple Binary Tree: Defined in binary_trees.h by the struct binary_tree_s structure with fields for:
n: Integer value stored in the node.
parent: Pointer to the parent node.
left: Pointer to the left child node.
right: Pointer to the right child node.
Project Focus (Tasks 0-23)
This initial phase focuses on implementing functions for basic operations on simple binary trees. These functions might include:

Creating a new binary tree node.
Inserting a node into the tree.
Traversing the tree using different methods (preorder, inorder, postorder).
Deleting a node from the tree (if applicable for simple binary trees).
Note: Tasks 0-23 descriptions are not provided here. Refer to the task descriptions for specific details.

Additional Information
This project adheres to strict coding standards enforced by the Betty Style guide.
All header files are include-guarded to prevent multiple inclusions during compilation.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Choose a task (0-23) and refer to its specific description (if available).
Implement the required function(s) in a separate source file, adhering to the Betty Style guide and including necessary prototypes from binary_trees.h.
You can use the optional main.c file for testing purposes, but it won't be considered for grading.
Remember: The focus is on understanding and implementing basic binary tree operations.

Contributing
Feel free to contribute by adding functionalities beyond the initial tasks (0-23). You can explore implementing support for more complex tree structures like BSTs or AVL trees, following the same project structure and coding standards.

I hope this detailed README provides a clear understanding of the project goals, setup, and expectations. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
